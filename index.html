        <h2>ENIAC – 1945</h2>
        <p class="description">
            The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was the first general-purpose programmable electronic computer. It was primarily used for military calculations during World War II.
        </p>
        <p class="impact">
            ENIAC dramatically reduced the time required for complex calculations from days to hours. It marked the shift from mechanical to electronic computing, laying the groundwork for future digital computers and real-time processing.

    <div class="milestone">
        <h2>Intel 4004 – 1971</h2>
        <p class="description">
            The Intel 4004 was the world’s first microprocessor, integrating all CPU functions onto a single chip. It was designed for calculators but set the stage for future processors.
        </p>
        <p class="impact">
            The 4004 launched the microprocessor revolution, making computers smaller, faster, and more affordable. This innovation paved the way for personal computers and transformed computing from room-sized machines to desktop devices.
        </p>

    <div class="milestone">
        <h2>IBM Personal Computer – 1981</h2>
        <p class="description">
            IBM released its first personal computer (IBM PC), a major milestone that standardized hardware architecture and promoted mass adoption of PCs for business and personal use.
        </p>
        <p class="impact">
            The IBM PC created a common platform for software developers, enabling a booming PC ecosystem. It established Microsoft and Intel as industry leaders and made computing accessible to homes and offices worldwide.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="milestone">
        <h2>World Wide Web – 1991</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Invented by Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web allowed users to access information over the Internet using hyperlinks and browsers.
        </p>
        <p class="impact">
            The web transformed how people interact with computers, shifting computing from isolated tasks to a global, connected experience. It revolutionized education, communication, and commerce through online services.
        </p>

    <div class="milestone">
        <h2>Apple M1 Chip – 2020</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Apple's M1 chip marked a major transition from Intel processors to Apple Silicon in Macs, featuring ARM-based architecture and unified memory.
        </p>
        <p class="impact">
            The M1 chip boosted performance and energy efficiency, enabling Macs to deliver better speed with less power. It demonstrated the power of vertical integration in hardware-software design, influencing other manufacturers to consider custom chips.
